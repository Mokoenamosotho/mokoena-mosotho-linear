Linear Regression Model using Burn in Rust

üìå Project Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression Model in Rust using the burn deep learning framework. The model learns to approximate a simple linear function:

using gradient descent and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. The project includes:
Generating Synthetic Data with noise.
Defining a Model using burn.
Training the Model to minimize loss.
Evaluating Performance with predictions and ASCII plots.

Getting Started

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
Rust & Cargo ‚Üí Install Rust
Burn Library (Machine Learning)
Rand Library (Generating Random Data)
Textplots Library (ASCII Graphs)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup the Project

Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

# Clone the repo (replace with your actual repo URL)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-burn.git
cd linear-regression-burn

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Add the required dependencies to your Cargo.toml:

[dependencies]
burn = {version= "0.16.0‚Äù , features = ["wgpu‚Äù , "train‚Äù] }
burn-ndarray= "0.16.0‚Äù
rand = "0.9.0 ‚Äù
rgb = "0.8.50‚Äù
textplots = "0.8.6"

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Model

To train and test the linear regression model, run:

üìú Project Breakdown

1Ô∏è‚É£ Generating Synthetic Data
The dataset consists of (x, y) pairs where y = 2x + 1 + noise.
We introduce random noise to simulate real-world scenarios.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Defining the Model
A simple Linear Regression Model with one weight and one bias.
Forward pass: y_pred = weight * x + bias.
Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss for optimization.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Training the Model
Uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
Updates weight and bias iteratively to minimize loss.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluating & Plotting Results
Tests the trained model on new data.

üõ† Challenges Faced

Incorrect Cargo.toml Syntax: Had issues with curly quotes (‚Äù vs "), causing parsing errors. and i wasnt able to run the project and add the directories and fix the errors.

Missing link.exe Error: The Rust compiler couldn‚Äôt find link.exe (needed for MSVC). Wasnt still able to Solve the error even after by installing Visual Studio with C++ Build Tools.
